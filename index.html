    <br>FOOD <em>the bite:</em></br>
    <h1>FEED THE SWIMMERS</h1>
    <br>By Natalie Goel</p>
    <p>Sensible eating is always a good idea, but once spring rolls around and the rich-food-filled days of winter wind down, it becomes a renewed focus for many of us. As we begin to shed layers and hunt for wholesome, delicious recipes, we’re turning to Instagrammer Jill Fergus of @feedtheswimmers for inspiration.</p>
    <p>Jill’s concoctions speak to all our latest cravings — fruit and coconut milk sorbet, lemony, smashed and roasted artichokes and matcha rice pudding are among her recent recipes. And beyond the flavors, she also packs her feed with a rainbow of hues, an upbeat personality and a peek into her everyday life as a “swim mom”. It’s an all-around delightful Instagram account, and also a one-stop shop, since most recipes can be found right in the captions. Get to know Jill’s palette, food philosophy and entertaining tips right here, and find out the recipe for her miso salmon burgers.</p>
